What is the output of the following program? Be precise about where there are spaces and where there are newlines.
Hint: Start by describing in words what ping and baffle do when they are invoked.

No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.


Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping is invoked.

main [ ]
zoop [ ]
baffle [ ]
ping [ ]


What happens if you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method?

It would output "wug." indefinitely.

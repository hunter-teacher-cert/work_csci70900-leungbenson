To teach NetLogo:

I would first show a sample model from netLogo and explain how to navigate it.

Then I'll have students explore different models and pick their favorite.

They'll be put into groups to share their findings, such as what they like/disliked, anything interesting that came up, etc.

Then explain to them that at the end they will be able to create something similar.

I would model a very simple program such as what DW did with the turtle.

The students would create a similar program, but try to write their names with the turle.
